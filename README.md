# Enigma GenAI Challenges

Welcome to the **Enigma GenAI Challenges**, a global initiative by **Enigma** to explore the exciting field of Generative AI while contributing to a broader community of innovators. This project invites participants to engage with creative AI technologies in art, music, and text generation while making valuable contributions to the open-source community.

## Problem Statements Overview

### Level 0: Redesign the Enigma Logo (PS 0.1)

- **Objective**: Use a Generative AI tool (e.g., DALLÂ·E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion) to create a new version of the Enigma logo.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Generate a redesigned logo for Enigma using any AI-powered image generation tool.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Within the `Level0` directory, create a folder with the same name as your username.
  - Include the AI-generated logo in `.png` or `.jpg` format.
  - Also, submit a text file named `model_and_prompt.txt`, including:
    - The AI model/tool used.
    - The exact prompt that you used to generate the logo.

### Level 1: Complete the Image Using Generative AI (PS 1.1)

- **Objective**: Complete an incomplete image by generating the missing part using any Generative AI tool.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Use a Generative AI tool to fill in the missing part of a provided image.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Within the `Level1` directory, create a folder with the same name as your username.
  - Include the completed AI-generated image.
  - Also, submit a text file named `model_and_prompt.txt`, including:
    - The AI model/tool used.
    - The exact prompt that you used to generate the missing part.

### Level 2: Generate a Spooky Beat Using Local AI Tools (PS 2.1)

- **Objective**: Create a spooky-themed beat using a local Generative AI music tool (e.g., Magenta, RAVE).

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Generate a unique spooky beat using AI tools that run locally without relying on cloud-based services.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Within the `Level2` directory, create a folder with the same name as your username.
  - Include the AI-generated beat in `.mp3` or `.wav` format.
  - Also, submit a text file named `tools_and_process.txt`, including:
    - The tool or framework you used (e.g., Magenta, RAVE).
    - The steps and parameters used to generate the beat.

### Level 3: Generate Poetry Without Using LLMs (PS 3.1)

- **Objective**: Generate poetry using non-LLM-based techniques, such as Markov chains or grammar-based models.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Implement a model that generates poetry using methods other than Large Language Models (LLMs). You may use techniques like Markov chains, grammar-based models, or any other approach that does not involve LLMs.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Within the `Level3` directory, create a folder with the same name as your username.
  - Include the AI-generated poem in `.txt` format.
  - Also, submit a text file named `methodology.txt`, including:
    - A detailed explanation of the method used to generate the poem.
    - The steps taken to build and run the model.
    - (Optional) Include code files if applicable to help others replicate your solution.
